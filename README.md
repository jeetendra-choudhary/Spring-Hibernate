## Spring Inversion Of Control & Dependency Injection -

Inversion of control is concept of outsourcing the object contrction to Object Factory. By Using this concept the control of object creation is inverted to object factory instead of the app/class utilising or consuming it hence it is called inversion of control. The injection of the object factory reference in to the class utilising or consuming the object factory refernce is called dependency injection. Because of the above mentioned fact the inversion of control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) goes hand in hand. IOC & DI can be used in below mentioned ways using the spring framework - 


## Spring IOC Configuration using different approaches
 
### Spring Inversion of Control - XML Configuration

- Dependency Injection & IOC By Constructor Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Setter Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Method Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Literal Injection

### Bean Life Cycle & Scope Configuration using xml

### Spring Inversion of Control - Java Annotations

- Dependency Injection & IOC By Constructor Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Setter Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Method Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Literal Injection

### Bean Life Cycle & Scope Configuration using Annotation

### Spring Inversion of Control - Java Class

- Dependency Injection & IOC By Constructor Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Setter Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Method Injection
- Dependency Injection & IOC By Literal Injection
